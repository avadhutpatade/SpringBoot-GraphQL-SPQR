API Query Language
Created By Facebook
Open source in 2015
Its a Specification
Wraps REST APIs
Single Endpoint
Schema Based

No wildcard support: Reasons:
	1) App braks in obvious ways
	2) Overfetching on newly added Relations
Need to explicitly tell which attributes to fetch (* not supported)
Solution: Fragments
Declaration: fragment UserFragment on Users {
	id,
	firstname,
	lastname
}
Usgae: FetchUsers {
	users(id : 2) {
		field,
		UserFragment,
		anotherfield
	}
}

Advantages over REST:
	1) Resolves overfetching (Avoid fetching all the associated relations data and fetch only specified data)
	2) Resolves underfetching (Fetching specified multiple related/non-related entities in a request)
	3) Supports multiple entities updatation in single request (related/non-related/both)
	4) Faster
	5) Simpler
